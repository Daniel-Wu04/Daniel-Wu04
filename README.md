Hello there! My name is Daniel Wu. My pronouns are He/Him.

I am currently a student at the Rutgers University Honors College, New Brunswick, pursuing a B.A. in Computer Science and a B.S. in Data Science. I am planning to graduate by December 2025. As a student, I am continuously learning through my classes as well as my own endeavors. I am a curious individual who wants to understand how different systems and processes work.

I am currently working on acquiring new certificates to showcase my knowledge.

Interests: Not everything is always about computers and tech! I enjoy working out at the gym and meeting new people there. I am also into cars and motorcycles, as well as maintaining my vehicles. Currently, I'm riding a Yamaha R7. I also snowboard during the winter and am always willing to tackle a double black diamond. Some might call me an adrenaline junkie.

Favorite Quote:

"Jack of all trades, master of none, though oftentimes better than master of one."

This is a quote I tend to relate to. My skill set is diverse; I like to fill in the gaps in a team and support wherever it is needed most. One person can only do so much compared to a cohesive and fluid team in any field.
