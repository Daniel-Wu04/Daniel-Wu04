Favourite Quote: 

"Jack of all trades, master of none, though oftentimes better than master of one"

This is a quote I tend to relate to. My skill set is diverse where I like to fill in the gaps in a team and support where ever is required the most. 
One person can only do so much compared to a cohesive and fluid team in any field.
